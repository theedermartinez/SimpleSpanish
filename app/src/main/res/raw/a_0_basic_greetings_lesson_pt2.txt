Beyond just saying hello, greetings in Spanish often include gestures and follow-up questions. For example, it’s common to ask "¿Qué tal?" (How’s it going?) or "¿Cómo te va?" (How’s it going for you?), which show genuine interest in the other person. In Spanish-speaking cultures, a handshake, a hug, or even a kiss on the cheek may accompany the greeting, depending on the relationship and cultural norms. By practicing these greetings and understanding their nuances, you’ll be better equipped to connect with Spanish speakers and immerse yourself in their rich and vibrant culture.
