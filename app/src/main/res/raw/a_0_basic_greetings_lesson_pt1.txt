In casual settings, you can use simple phrases like "¡Hola!" (Hello!) or "¿Cómo estás?" (How are you?). If you’re meeting someone for the first time or addressing someone older or in a professional context, it’s more appropriate to say "¿Cómo está usted?" to show respect. Additionally, phrases such as "Buenos días" (Good morning), "Buenas tardes" (Good afternoon), and "Buenas noches" (Good evening) are widely used and suitable for various levels of formality. These time-specific greetings help demonstrate politeness and cultural understanding.
