        /*
        BufferedReader bf = makeBufferedReader("quiz_high_scores_inorder");
        int highScoreInt = -1;
        try
        {
            String highScore = bf.readLine();
            String highScoreDisplay = "High Score:" +highScore;
            pushToFront(highScoreDisplay,"quiz0_maxscore_textid");
            highScoreInt = Integer.parseInt(highScore);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            makeAlertStop("Error pushing score");
